LockSupport is used in place of wait and notify because if we not use wait/notify in proper 
oreder deadlock condition araise because when we call notify() it does not hold signal
it lost so when we call notify() before wait() the signal because lost and thread where
we call wait() goes into sleep status and never became awake

but in LockSupport we use park() and unpark() 
when we call unpark(Threadname(T1)) inside any thread(T2)  . jvm store one permit for T1
same way if we call LockSupport.park() inside thread T2 jvm remove this permit and permit
became for T2 is = 0 and once permit is 0 jvm block this thread than OS schedular schedule
other thread to get run.

if we call LockSupport.park() than again call LocalSUpport.park() permit still 0 not -1
same way if we call LocalSupport.unpark() than again LocalSupport.unpark() permit still 1 not 2
