✅ What is Livelock?

Livelock occurs when threads are active and running, but no useful work is completed
Threads keep reacting to each other and retrying endlessly
System appears alive, but progress = 0

❓ Why Livelock Occurs

Symmetric retry behavior
Multiple threads retry at the same time
Same timeout, same logic
Immediate retries
No delay between retries
Threads collide again instantly
Over-polite lock release
Threads release locks to avoid deadlock
But retry too quickly
No retry limit
Infinite retry loops (while(true))
Nested retries
Multiple layers retry independently
Amplifies contention

Solutions to Livelock

Bounded retries
Limit retry attempts
Backoff strategy
Add delay between retries
Randomized jitter
Desynchronize retry timing
Single retry owner
Retry only at top-level service
Fail fast in lower layers
No nested retries

:- in code we make create situation of livelock by just make two changes use while loop 
which run indefinitly and use continue in catch block where Retryable exception throw

summary-> in simple word like in deadlock both thread goes in blocked state and then shutdown
but in livelock both thread unlock themself using ReentrantLock lock but no progress hapen forward

execution step->

order thread -T1
inventory thread - T2

senarion1:- (both service acquire by T1 when we not hit inventory service)

senario2:-(both service hit at same time)
T1 acquire orderService
T2 acquire inventoryservice
T1 try to acquire inventory but lock exist and it throw exception
exception return and T1 call backoff where T1 goes into sleep
now T2 try to acquire order but don't than exception throw and T2 unlock it'self
now when T1 awake T1 acquire inventory
