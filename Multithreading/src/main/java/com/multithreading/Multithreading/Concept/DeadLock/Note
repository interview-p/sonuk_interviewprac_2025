here how Deadlock happen:->

here from orderservice call reserveStock method of inventory service and inventoryService 
call reserveStock from orderservice both method are synchronized it's mean when we call 
rest api from browser a thread intiated by springboot mainlly two different one for order and 
one for inventory.

t1- order
t2- inventory

t1 hit first and enter into orderService method and apply lock on orderservice class(object)
and t1 goes into sleep
now t2 enter into inventoryService and acquire lock and go to sleep after this when t1 try to
acquire inventoryservice it see it lock by t1 and t1 goes to BLOCKED state same 
t2 goes to orderService and see it is acquire by t1 so t2 goes to BLOCKED

#@Lazy -> used because order and inventory is singleton object and try to inject their dependency
at runtime and not found so circular dependency error come to solve this use @Lazy
