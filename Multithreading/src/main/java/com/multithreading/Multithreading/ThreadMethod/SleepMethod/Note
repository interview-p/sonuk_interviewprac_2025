when we write
“My thread will run again exactly after 1000 ms”
correct meaning - “Do NOT schedule this thread for at least 1000 ms”

Internally:
Thread.sleep(1000);
JVM makes a system call to the OS
OS marks the thread as TIMED_WAITING
Thread is removed from the CPU run queue
A timer is registered for 1000 ms
After 1000 ms:
Thread becomes RUNNABLE
NOT running yet ❗
OS scheduler decides when CPU is available
Thread finally runs

#Why delay happens after sleep ends

Even after sleep time expires, the thread may wait because:
OS scheduling reasons
CPU is busy
Higher-priority threads are running
Context switching overhead
GC pause
OS timer granularity

# Best practices (production-grade)
✅ Use sleep() for:

Backoff
Retry delay
Polling loops
❌ Do NOT use sleep() for:
Precise timing
Scheduling tasks
Coordination between threads
Use instead:
ScheduledExecutorService
wait/notify
Latches, semaphores
