this is the sample code of how springboot use interrupt
we use async with interrupt

action:- when we shutdown app spring call following step

@Async method running on payment-async-1

SIGTERM / context.close()
        ↓
Spring calls executor.shutdownNow()
        ↓
ThreadPoolExecutor interrupts worker thread
        ↓
Thread.sleep() throws InterruptedException
        ↓
You restore interrupt
        ↓
Loop exits
        ↓
Task finishes
        ↓
Spring shuts down cleanly



In Spring, @Async tasks run on a ThreadPoolExecutor. During shutdown or cancellation, 
Spring interrupts the worker thread. The async method must handle InterruptedException 
properly; otherwise, tasks may prevent graceful shutdown


Spring does NOT require re-interrupt just to shut down.

Spring requires re-interrupt so that:
Cancellation propagates
Executors behave correctly
Higher layers can react
Future cancellation works
Code is composable
