	/*
	1> grpc is protocol based on http/2 which support data transmission in binary(fast) and support 
	   multiplexing(bi-directional)
	   
	2> rest use http/1 which support single plex and transmit data in plain text(json)
	
	3> grpc is fast becoz it support binary tranmission when we do transmit data spring convert 
	   or say seliaze in json formate(text maapping) which is slow
	   
	4> will continue later some topic - grpc is framework like springboot it is king of bean inside 
	   of springboot,is protobuf is same as grpc, after adding net dev dependency server not start
